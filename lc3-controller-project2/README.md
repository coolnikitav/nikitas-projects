# LC-3 Project 2: Pipelined LC3 Microcontroller With A Comprehensive Instruction Set

## Description

## Modules
This LC3 Microcontroller consists of 6 modules: Fetch, Decode, Execute, Memaccess, Writeback, Controller. Modules were designed and verified individually. Then they were combined into a main LC3 module and it was verified that all 5 stages of the pipeline worked cohesively. 

Each of the folders has specifications, intended module behavior, schematics, design files, testbench files, and simulation outputs:
- [LC3](LC3) - Combines the 6 modules into a full pipelined processor
- [Controller](controller)
- [Fetch](fetch)
- [Decode](decode)
- [Execute](execute)
- [Memaccess](memaccess)
- [Writeback](writeback)
